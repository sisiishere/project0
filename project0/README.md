# Project 0

This project goes in depth on my app that involves everything involving myself. My app has four pages including: a main page that welcomes a viewer to this app, a list of three things I love with three reasons per item, a table consisting my top 20 favourite celebrities, and three images of destinations I wish I was in (if the outbreak was not here).
